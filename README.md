# SRGP
A simple graphics library for C.
The Simple Raster Graphics Package is composed of a library of functions, and a header file ("srgp.h") that defines custom data types and constants, and which prototypes all SRGP routines.

## Example
A simple live chart implementation found at [here](https://github.com/0xfe0/SRGP/blob/master/tests/live_chart.c). \

## What works in this rewrite?
Almost everything, just try to only work with windows of depth 24 (which is default for many screens these days).
