# SRGP
The Simple Raster Graphics Package is composed of a library of functions, and a header file ("srgp.h") that defines custom data types and constants, and which prototypes all SRGP routines.

## What works in this rewrite?
Almost everything, just try to only work with windows of depth 24 (which is default for many screens these days).
